description: >
  A Jellyfin plugin to integrate [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/docs/) with
  [Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/shoko-server/).

  ## Read this before installing

  **This plugin requires that you have already set up and are using Shoko Server**,
  and that the files you intend to include in Jellyfin are **indexed** (and
  optionally managed) by Shoko Server. **Otherwise, the plugin won't be able to
  provide metadata for your files**, since there is no metadata to find for them.
