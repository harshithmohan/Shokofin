# Shokofin

A Jellyfin plugin to integrate [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/docs/) with
[Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/shoko-server/).

## Read this before installing

**This plugin requires that you have already set up and are using Shoko Server**,
and that the files you intend to include in Jellyfin are **indexed** (and
optionally managed) by Shoko Server. **Otherwise, the plugin won't be able to
provide metadata for your files**, since there is no metadata to find for them.

### What Is Shoko?

Shoko is an anime cataloging program designed to automate the cataloging of your
collection regardless of the size and amount of files you have. Unlike other
anime cataloging programs which make you manually add your series or link the
files to them, Shoko removes the tedious, time-consuming and boring task of
having to manually add every file and manually input the file information. You
have better things to do with your time like actually watching the series in
your collection so let Shoko handle all the heavy lifting.

      interviews, etc. as extra features, and all other specials as episodes in
      season zero.

  - [X] Map OPs/EDs to Theme Videos, so they can be displayed as background video

    the items in Shoko.

    - [X] Choose between three ways to group your Shows/Seasons; no grouping,
      following TvDB (to-be replaced with TMDB soon™-ish), and using Shoko's
      groups feature.

      _For the best compatibility it is **strongly** advised **not** to use
      "season" folders with anime as it limits which grouping you can use, you
      can still create "seasons" in the UI using Shoko's groups or using the
      TvDB/TMDB compatibility mode._

    - [X] Optionally create Box-Sets for your Movies…

      - [X] using the Shoko series.

      - [X] using the Shoko groups.

      libraries.

      _Provided you apply the workaround to do it_.

  - [/] Automatically populates all missing episodes not in your collection, so
    you can see at a glance what you are missing out on.

      in Shoko.
